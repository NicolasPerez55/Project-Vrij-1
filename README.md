# Project-Vrij-1
 The project Vrij of team 15 #ShitNation


NOTES ABOUT WORKING ON THE PROJECT:
1- Work on your own scene! Multiple people making changes to the same scene is a recipe for merge conflicts. Just make a copy of your main scene, and 
as much as possible work with prefabs and similar to make putting your changes into the main scene later easier

2- If a folder is getting very cluttered, consider making a sub folder (for example, for scripts related to the player, or for sprites related to a specific object)

3- Recommended that you use Fork, SourceTree, or similar. Not mandatory, but it will help keep track of changes over the project

4- Have fun :3
